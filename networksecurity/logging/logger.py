"""
This Python code sets up a logging system that writes logs to a uniquely named file in a folder called logs.

- logging: Built-in module to track events that happen when software runs.
- os: Module for interacting with the operating system (e.g., creating directories).
- datetime: Used to generate a timestamp for the log file name.

in basicConfig:

- filename: Where to write logs.
- format: 
    How log messages will appear: %(asctime)s = Timestamp
                                  %(lineno)d = Line number in the source code
                                  %(name)s = Loggerâ€™s name
                                  %(levelname)s = Log level (INFO, ERROR, etc.)
                                  %(message)s = The actual message

- level=logging.INFO: Records INFO and higher level messages (e.g., WARNING, ERROR)
